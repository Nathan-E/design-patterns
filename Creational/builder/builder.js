/**
 * Another way to delegate the task of creating objects to another object is using the 
 * builder pattern. This pattern is used to create complex objects that usually require 
 * a step-by-step approach.
 * 
 * In the classical definition, this pattern involves the following actors:
*   The client: This is the object that needs a new object
*   The director: This is the actor who knows how to create an object, that is, it knows 
                  the necessary steps to get an object built using the builder.
*   The builder: This actor actually builds the object by providing methods used by the director
*   The product: It is the resulting object built by the builder under the control of the director
