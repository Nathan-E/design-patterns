They are various ways to create Object in JavaScript...since everything in JS is an Object, we have
to be careful how we create Object and always follow the best approach for a certain scenario 

Ways to Create Object
  Object literal
  Constructor function

The two custom methods above have their strengths and short-coming which we will discuss later

                                              IMPORTANT!!!!
You may be wondering why you would want to leave the responsibility of the construction of objects 
to others rather than simply calling a constructor function with the new keyword directly. 
The reason is that that constructor functions are limited in their control over the overall creation 
process and sometimes you will need to hand over control to a factory that has broader knowledge.

This includes scenarios in which the creation process involves object caching, sharing or re-using 
of objects, complex logic, or applications that maintain object and type counts, and objects that 
interact with different resources or devices. If your application needs more control over the object 
creation process, consider using a Factory.
