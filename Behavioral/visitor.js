/**
 * In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of 
 * separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this 
 * separation is the ability to add new operations to existent object structures without modifying the 
 * structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.
 * 
 * In essence, the visitor allows adding new virtual functions to a family of classes, without modifying 
 * the classes. Instead, a visitor class is created that implements all of the appropriate specializations 
 * of the virtual function. The visitor takes the instance reference as input, and implements the goal through double dispatch.
 */

/**
 * What problems can the Visitor design pattern solve? 
 * 
 * It should be possible to define a new operation for (some) classes of an object structure without changing the classes.
 * When new operations are needed frequently and the object structure consists of many unrelated classes, 
 * it's inflexible to add new subclasses each time a new operation is required because "[..] distributing all 
 * these operations across the various node classes leads to a system that's hard to understand, maintain, and change." 
 * 
 * What solution does the Visitor design pattern describe?
 * 
 * Define a separate (visitor) object that implements an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure.
 * Clients traverse the object structure and call a dispatching operation accept(visitor) on an element â€” that 
 * "dispatches" (delegates) the request to the "accepted visitor object". The visitor object then performs the 
 * operation on the element ("visits the element").
 * 
 * This makes it possible to create new operations independently from the classes of an object structure by adding new visitor objects.
